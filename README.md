Your guide for city of Helsinki. Including places,events,activities and more about the city .
<br />
While doing this application had the chance to learn some of the Typescript basics with react in the frontend.
<br />
#Backend .Net [backend repo ](https://github.com/erkanisuf/creatingNETCore5Backend/)
<br />
In the backend learned some of the basics of the C# and .Net framework . The application itself uses the public API of helsinki (http://open-api.myhelsinki.fi/). I customized the api in the backend for my own needs.
The backened server provides users interface (registration,login,password reset , emails) and hold some Data for the reviews of the places in Helsinki.
<br />
Backend is deployed in Azure Cloud and front end is in netlify.
